# SQL Cheat Sheet

## SQLâ€¦ S-Q-L? Sequel.

SQL - Structured Query Language

A domain-specific programming language used for managing data held in relational databases management systems (RDBMs)

SQL can be used for:
* querying data (select)
* manipulating data (insert, update, delete)
* defining data (schema creation/modification)
* controlling access to data

There are several types, or flavors of SQL created by different organizations for different purposes

Most flavors of SQL operate on the same basic principles with slightly different syntax. The differences can largely be ignored when you're starting out.

## Select... From... Where...

**SELECT** - these columns
**FROM** - this table
**WHERE** - these critera are met

Almost every query that extracts data from a database will have these three clauses in order to specify which data you need. They're always used in the same order.

For example

### Table:

| Year | Person | Income |
| :--- | :----- | :----- |
| 2016 | James  | 10,000 |
| 2016 | Kate   | 11,000 |
| 2016 | Sam    | 10,000 |
| 2017 | James  | 10,000 |
| 2017 | Kate   | 12,000 |
| 2017 | Sam    | 11,000 |
| 2018 | James  | 11,000 |
| 2018 | Kate   | 12,000 |
| 2018 | Sam    | 12,000 |

### Query:

**SELECT** year, person  
**FROM** income_table  
**WHERE** income > 11,000  

### Results:

| Year | Person |
| :--- | :----- |
| 2017 | Kate   |
| 2018 | Kate   |
| 2018 | Sam    |

In other words, the output of the query is the intersect of the **SELECT** and **WHERE** clauses.

## Dimensions vs Metrics

Dimensions are attributes of our data, they are not aggregated. Meanwhile metrics are quantitative measurements that are aggregated.

The **GROUPBY** clause is added to the end of a query that contains aggregation functions in order to distinguish between the dimensions and metrics in the query.

Here's an example using the same table from above.

### Query:

**SELECT**  person  
            , COUNT(DISTINCT year) AS years  
            , SUM(income) AS money_earned  
**FROM**    income_table  
**WHERE**   year > 2016  
**AND**     income > 10,000  
**GROUP BY** person  

### Results:

| person | years | money_earned |
| :----- | :---- | :----------- |
| Kate   | 3     | 35,000       |
| Sam    | 2     | 23,000       |
| James  | 1     | 11,000       |

## Aggregation Functions

Aggregation functions create metrics by performing a quantitative operation on a column. In the example above, we add the income earned by each person for the years they earned over $10,000.

Some commonly used aggregation functions are:
* COUNT()
* SUM()
* AVG()
* MAX()
* MIN()

The COUNT function can accept a variety of parameters that modify the way it operates.
* COUNT(\*) - counts the number of rows in the table
* COUNT(DISTINCT <column_name>) - counts the number of unique values in a column
* COUNT(<column_name>) - counts the number of rows in a column where there is a non-NULL value

## Additional Useful Syntax

**IN** - enables the specification of multiple values to satisfy a criterion in a **WHERE** clause.
**LIMIT** - limits the number of rows returned by a query to the first XX number of rows in the result set.
**ORDER BY ASC|DESC** - sorts the output by one or more of the columns in the resulting table (defaults to ASC)
